In this part I will talk a bit more about the tools and workflows I use to be more productive daily. It is not just good for developer I think but also in general for people.

## Second Brain

For me, the main thing is beaing able to store and find information as fast as possible. You just can't have evertyhing memorized - I mostly use Notion as my "Second brain". With Second brain, the goal is to have *Knowledge that will probably never change*(eh. bash commands, git commands) and *Knowledge that may take you a while to re-learn* (eg. How to setup a dockerfile) always on hand. To achieve this I've made a Note taking system which helps me achieve this task and looks like this:

Here I have evertyhing important in overview. I've made 4 categories

- Daily thing I'm updating
- Work related pages 
- Goals and Plans - where I keep track of longerm and shorterm Plans
- Todo - just a simple todo list to remind me of important tasks

This is the bread and butter of my "second brain". Lets say I'm in my "Work notebook", I usually update this daily since I use this to write notes about work, set timestamps for meetings and in general document issues or problems that arrise during development. I really like to have a small log of things I've done daily to come back to. When there is something new I'm working on, lets say a feature that uses a third party library or service, I can use the engineering wiki section of my notion setup where I write down steps to initialize the library or setup a service. So in the future me, or a colleague, does the same we do not have to loose the time again googling and tinkering about everything. We can use my notes and check what I have done last time and get up to speed fast. So there is one benefit of offloading things. 

Besides work, the other sections provide some pages where I track some personal things, which for this I think is not that important.

I personally use notion for this but to be honest you can use a paper if you want to it really makes no difference. 

## Pomodoro with a twist

Pomodoro is a well known method of work, where you set a timer for 20-25 minutes - work for the time and then make a small 5 to 10 minute break. Well, for me personally that is an awesome approach to  distraction free work. I do use a pomodoro timer (link) with the values set to 1h of work time and then 5 minutes of break. As a developer you need a bit more time to get into a task and start working productively (at least for me). 

However I like to combine pomodoro with a Daily Highlight technique

Daily Higlighting (From the book - Make Time TODO: ADD link), like the name implies, is just a way to select 1 or more Daily Highlights but with the intention of finishing it. In the words of the book: 

> Asking yourself “What’s going to be the highlight of my day?” ensures that you spend time on what matters most to you and don’t lose the entire day reacting to other people’s priorities.

It is a way to Prioritize tasks and focus on it. Not alwys can we achieve that of course and sometimes there are random things which distract us, but you can always use the next day to redo the daily highlight. It does not matter when you do it it matters that you do it.

## Distraction avoidence (or at least try)

One of the hardest things, especially now with home office, is to work distraction free. Some of the things I use to avoid distraction:

- Distraction Journal - Suprisingly this helped me personally a lot.. 

- Zenmode - I usually use zenmode in VSCode when I need concetnration and focus on a task.
- Limit the internet connection or even block it - I've seen people also do that, for me its a bit of overkill but I've seen people doing this too. 
- Mute or Do not disturb mode on smartphones - This is something..

## Energize

## Reflect


 As a developer, I usually get into the situation where I need some code snippet or some CLI tool commands which are needed to setup something, well for those issues I use my "second brain" which I've made in Notion.
