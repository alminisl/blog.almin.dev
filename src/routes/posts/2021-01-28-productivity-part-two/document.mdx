## Second Brain

For me, the main thing is beaing able to store and find information as fast as possible. You just can't have evertyhing memorized - I mostly use Notion as my "Second brain". With Second brain, the goal is to have *Knowledge that will probably never change*(eh. bash commands, git commands) and *Knowledge that may take you a while to re-learn* (eg. How to setup a dockerfile) always on hand. To achieve this I've made a Note taking system which helps me achieve this task and looks like this:

Here I have evertyhing important in overview. I've made 4 categories

- Daily thing I'm updating
- Work related pages 
- Goals and Plans - where I keep track of longerm and shorterm Plans
- Todo - just a simple todo list to remind me of important tasks

This is the bread and butter of my "second brain". Next up, what am I doing with it and how do I use them



 As a developer, I usually get into the situation where I need some code snippet or some CLI tool commands which are needed to setup something, well for those issues I use my "second brain" which I've made in Notion.
