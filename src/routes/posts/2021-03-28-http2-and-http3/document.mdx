This blogpost is just a small reminder that I should learn more about HTTP2 and even HTTP3 (which Until a few days I did not know was a thing).

The HTTP2 is used in about 50% of websites, source for this can be found [here](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http2#:~:text=HTTP%2F2%20is%20used%20by%2050.5%25%20of%20all%20the%20websites).

More information about HTTP2 can be gound on the official google developers blog [link](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2) and also a super nice E-book I got recommended by Daniel Stenberg himself on a stream [link to ebook](https://http2-explained.haxx.se/en/part2).

Also from the same Author we can find the [http3 ebook](https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en). Luckily I'm on vacation and this seems like a nice thing to learn during the vacation off time.
