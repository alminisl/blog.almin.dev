If you had the same question as me, then you are in the right place! 

Lets learn about protobufs together. 

Few days ago I was watching a talk in which an API response was having 50% saved space during API calls. Instead of getting 300MB it was just 30MB. That was... insane. So I told myself, I HAVE to learn this magic and what is behind it. So after googling the first thing that came up was.. Google! 

The exact quote: 
> Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.

Ok, interesting, but XML? I hate XML(as many of you do I suppose).
