While I work on my guitar looper project, I had some problem I wanted to solve in regards to discord. As many other people I'm part of a few different Discord communities and that means postin random thing all over - so Linky bot came to life! 

So I wanted to create a discord bot for a while just to get to know how that works. So the process in itself is easier than I thought.

# Setting up the Bot

- Firstly you just need to create a new application on [discord app dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

You will be prompted with a modal to input a name of the bot and `Create` it!

- After you have done that you will be redirected to the `Application page` and should look something like this:


I've added a fancy Icon and also there are some overview of your current app. 

- Next up, we want to go to the `Bot` and hit Create and this is all that needs to be done here

- Now, the thing which confused me in other guides is the next step. They say that in the `Bot` tab there is a link which will add my bot to the discord server, but it is not. After adding the bot, you have to go back to `OAuth2` tab - select `bot` in the table and Copy the link.

> Disclaimer - The thing you will need from here is the Token and be careful ALWAYS keep the token secure as it allows anyone to log in to your bot.

Now you can open the link in the browser and you will be greeted with the windo to add the bot to one of the channels you are part of:

And you should see your Bot in the "online" list.
