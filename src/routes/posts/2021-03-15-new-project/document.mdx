import sketch from './sketch.jpg'



In the spirit of doing more IOT things I wanna do something usefull and something I want to use. Also I have another Raspberry pi laying around so I came up with this: 

<div>
    <img src={sketch}  />
</div>

So, this poorly drawing shows a "looper" pedal for a guitar. The main idea is to be able to record a part of a song and then let it play back. 
For the MVP version I just want to have 1 button (1 Track) that will be looped over. That should be enough for the prototype. The next step is adding more buttons to make it a bit more complicated hopefully. 

So let the hacking begin.
