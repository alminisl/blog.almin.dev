So for the longest time I've been ignoring the error message that my credentials are not set on Git when Pushing or Pulling a repository. 

After months of tedious entering username and password of github everytime I want to do something I decided to set my credentials.

However if you think it is just like on linux, you are **Wrong**.

At first I've also thought that doing `git config credential.helper store` or setting the git username / email would be enough but no, what you have to do in the WSL is execute the following command: 

```git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager.exe"``` 

(or wherver you path to `git-credential-manager.exe` is) and Voil√†! 

Now you never have to enter your username and password during push/pull of the code! Congratz!
