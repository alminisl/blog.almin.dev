It's alive! this blog is alive! After some screw up and configurations with Netlify, I finally made it work!

I think everyone is kinda being bored during this pandemic, so I thought lets start with a blog! Hopefully I don't drop this after a month (Future me, pls don't drop this after a month)

Something I'm keeping myself busy is learning more about technologies, optimizing my daily use of Windows and some pet projects. For now howerver I think I will leave it on this for my first post. I think that this will be a nice start to this, for one to make it easier for me to remember the stuff I'm learning. For second this could maybe help someone.
